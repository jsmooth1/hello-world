# hello-world
my first repository
===================

Welcome to my first Github repository!

I just heard about Github from a class at CAR2015 conference in Atlanta. The Instructor was very helpful (and cute too, which is always a plus). The conference introduced me to a lot of new and interesing technology, like : Python, Sublime, Tabula, Tableau, Import.io, Virtual Box, and Github. I've got a lot to learn. So, I better get started!
